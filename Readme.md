#  CSXAI: A Lightweight 2D CNN-SVM Model for Detection and Classification of Various Crop Diseases with Explainable AI Visualization.

## Published Paper: [CSXAI](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/382132792_CSXAI_a_lightweight_2D_CNN-SVM_model_for_detection_and_classification_of_various_crop_diseases_with_explainable_AI_visualization) 

#### Features: 
- The proposed CNN-SVM model is a lightweight model having only 400k parameters.
- The model has been trained on a larget dataset of 11,524 images. 
- This model is a combined technology of Machine learning and Deep learning (CNN-SVM).
- This model can have superior accuracy to some transfer learning models - VGG16, VGG19, ShuffleNet, MobileNet, MobileNet-V2, Inception-V3, Xception, DenseNet. 
- The proposed research provides accuracy graph, loss graph, ROC curve, classification reports, PR curve. 
- For showing the acceptance of the research, Matthews Correlation Coefficients (MCC) has also been provided with a descent value. 
- The classification of the four plants diseases has been explained by explainable-AI (Grad CAM). 
- The proposed research has outperformed other researchs by having a combination of CNN-SVM with a decent accuracy and explainable AI.
